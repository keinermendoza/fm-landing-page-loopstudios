# the challenge
I took the most of the time understanding the desing. I don't have the figma file but in
any case i found that open the jpg image in figma an draw a lot of frames arround images and text 
is very handy.

So, I break the desing in small pices, created react components for each one of them and then create a sass file
for each component. I created some utility classes for those pattern that dosen't bellow to any component and then make
a lot of adjusment for make the fonts, paddings dinamic.   

I have to say that even when this project uses react for componentization more than functionality there is nothing restricted to react here, I use a single useState so you can implement *all* this functionality wiht two ore three lines of pure js.

# The Challenge
I spent most of the time understanding the design. I don't have the Figma file, but in any case, I found that opening the JPG image in Figma and drawing a lot of frames around images and text is very handy.

So, I broke the design into small pieces, created React components for each one of them, and then created a Sass file for each component. I also created some utility classes for those patterns that donâ€™t belong to any specific component, and then made a lot of adjustments to make the fonts and paddings dynamic.

I have to say that even though this project uses React mainly for componentization rather than functionality, there is nothing restricted to React here. I use a single useState, so you could implement all this functionality with just two or three lines of pure JavaScript.

Feel free to give your opinion about the code, the solution design, the process I chose, the technology stack, the class names I wrote, or even my profile on this platform or GitHub. Any feedback will be valuable to me, as long as it has a reasoning behind it, with examples or resources.
